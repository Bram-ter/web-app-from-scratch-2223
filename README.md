This website was made for the communication and multimedia design <a href="https://github.com/cmda-minor-web">minor-web</a>, for the project <a href="https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/web-app-from-scratch-2223">Web App from scratch</a> 

## What is used in this project?

This project is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The API used in this project is hosted by <a href="https://api-ninjas.com/">api-ninjas.com</a>

## Getting started

clone to your local system with the following:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Bram-ter/web-app-from-scratch-2223.git`
```

Then you can just open the `index.html`, though it is recommended to use an application with a live server otherwise it will not access the api and give an CORS error.
