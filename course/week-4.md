## Assignment

Refactor code into modules, improve UI and write documentation.

<!-- ### Method

16 hours have been scheduled to work on this course this week (Monday and Tuesday). Try to plan your work well! In the meantime, progress is monitored in standup meetings and classroom meetings. Your code will be reviewed at Friday. Any issues will be placed in your GitHub repository. -->

## 1. Manipulate, filter and sort data (Monday)

To be able to view the data that you have loaded from an API in a more targeted way, add a filtering and sorting component to your web app. To properly filter and sort the data, it is useful to store data in an object that is part of your app or in LocalStorage. With the map, filter and reduce methods you always retrieve the desired data and display it in the interface.

## 2. Documentation (Monday)

When you pubish your code to Github, others can fork your code to use in their own project or collaborate with yours. 
It's important to write your Readme with a description of your own work, explenation of your code and a link and poster image to showcase your project.

When you're writing your project's README, it should be able to answer the what, why, and the how of the project.

```
- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages üåê
- Write a description of your work 
- Add a nice poster image showing off your shiny frontend üì∏

‚Äî Write a section that describes how to install this project ü§ì
- Write sections of how to use this project, what are its features ü§î
- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties üå†
- Add a checklist of done stuff and stuff you have still on your wishlist ‚úÖ

- Add a table of contents üìö

## 3. Improve UI (Tuesday)

In order to best help our users get up to speed with our designs, it is best to design for the zero state, the state in which nothing has yet occurred. This state shouldn't be a blank canvas‚Ä¶it should provide direction and guidance for getting up to speed. Much of the friction of interaction is in that initial context‚Ä¶ once people understand the rules they have a much higher likelihood of success.

### Design Zero state using Visual Hierarchy

Web pages and websites have a lot of information to communicate. When we land on a new page we immediately have some questions we need answered.

- Is what I‚Äôm looking for on this page?
- Where is it?
- How do I complete my task?

By creating visual hierarchies, designers enable pages to be scanned and make information easier to understand.

1. Ask a collegue to use your app and encourage him/her to think out loud while interactting with your app
2. Write down all feedback and remarks 
3. Try fixing the low hanging fruit immediately after the test, fix unclear labels/ enlarge important titles/ improve contrast/ ...
4. Create and write issues on your Github Repo with issues you cannot fix immediately, and label them using the MOSCOW method

### If it looks like a button it should act like a button

Appearance follows behavior
Humans are most comfortable with things that behave the way we expect. Other people, animals, objects, software. When someone or something behaves consistently with our expectations we feel like we have a good relationship with it. To that end designed elements should look like how they behave. Form follows function. In practice this means that someone should be able to predict how an interface element will behave merely by looking at it. If it looks like a button it should act like a button.
