## 1. Manipulate, filter and sort data (Monday)

To be able to view the data that you have loaded from an API in a more targeted way, add a filtering and sorting component to your web app. To properly filter and sort the data, it is useful to store data in an object that is part of your app or in LocalStorage. With the map, filter and reduce methods you always retrieve the desired data and display it in the interface.

## 2. Documentation (Monday)

When you pubish your code to Github, others can fork your code to use in their own project or collaborate with yours. 
It's important to write your Readme with a description of your own work, explenation of your code and a link and poster image to showcase your project.

When you're writing your project's README, it should be able to answer the what, why, and the how of the project.

```
- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages 🌐
- Write a description of your work
- Showcase your project with Github Pages, add the url to the readme and add the url to the About  🌍
- Add a nice poster image showing off your shiny frontend 📸

— Write a section that describes how to install this project 🤓
- Write sections of how to use this project? What are its features 🤔
- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties 🌠
- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅

- Add a table of contents 📚

```
