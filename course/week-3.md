## 1. Handle routes to manage state 

On a single page web app you will have to create the URLs (or routes) to the different "pages" in JavaScript. For example if you want to be able to navigate to a detail page. You can do this by using the hash (#) in the url, in combination with the hashchange event. Making a router yourself is quite complicated, so this is a good opportunity to use a micro library. Routie.js is a simple hash router that you can use.

## 2. Refactor code into modules 

Now that you have gained a better understanding, using the diagrams, it may be time to refactor the structure of your app. In other words, how are you going to code or refactor the various actors and the dependencies between them in your app? Split up your code into modules.
